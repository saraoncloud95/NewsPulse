# üì∞  **NewsPulse: Real-Time News Aggregator & Recommendation Platform**

### üéØ Goal

Build a platform that collects live news from multiple sources, processes articles in real time, tags them with NLP (using AWS Comprehend), stores metadata, and serves a personalized news feed via APIs & a dashboard.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Architecture

* **Ingestion**

  * Lambda scheduled jobs to fetch RSS/JSON feeds ‚Üí publish to **Kinesis Stream**
  * Optional WebSocket API for live article submissions
* **Processing**

  * EKS microservice (Python/Node) consuming from Kinesis
  * Uses **AWS Comprehend** for sentiment + entity extraction
  * Writes article metadata to RDS (Postgres)
  * Raw articles stored in S3 (`news-raw`)
* **Serving**

  * REST API (FastAPI/Express) on EKS, behind ALB (TLS via ACM)
  * Frontend (React) hosted on S3 + CloudFront (`app.newspulse.dev`)
* **Recommendations**

  * Simple ‚Äúmost popular in last hour‚Äù from Athena queries on S3
  * Stretch: Redis for caching trending results
* **CI/CD**

  * Jenkins CI ‚Üí build/test/scan images, push to ECR, update Helm values
  * ArgoCD ‚Üí GitOps sync to EKS
* **Secrets & Security**

  * AWS Secrets Manager + External Secrets Operator
  * IAM roles via IRSA for Kinesis + S3 access
  * WAF rules for API (SQLi/XSS protection)
* **Observability**

  * Prometheus + Grafana + Alertmanager
  * OpenTelemetry traces (API latency, processing times)
  * CloudWatch alarms: ingestion lag, API 5xx
* **Reliability**

  * HPA on API + processor pods
  * Argo Rollouts for canary deploys
  * Chaos testing with LitmusChaos
* **Backups & DR**

  * RDS daily snapshots (14 days retention)
  * S3 lifecycle to IA + Glacier
  * Terraform state in versioned S3

   * Create RDS Postgres instance (db.t3.medium is fine for demo).
   * Place in private subnets.
   * Store creds in AWS Secrets Manager.

5. **S3 Buckets**
<img width="1048" height="258" alt="Screenshot from 2025-08-22 11-10-33" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8817548d-3efb-4125-b834-1a557fbf191d" />

   * This will be the pipeline between ingestion Lambda and processor service.

7. **ECR Repository**

# Step 1: Building the Core Infrastructure for NewsPulse

## Introduction

Every successful digital platform begins with a strong foundation. For **NewsPulse**, a real-time news aggregator and recommendation system, this foundation is built on a set of core AWS services that ensure security, scalability, and reliability. Step 1 focuses on establishing the **networking, compute, storage, and streaming backbone** of the system before moving to application development.

---

## 1. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) & Networking

A dedicated **VPC** provides a secure, isolated environment for all application components.

* **Public subnets** host the Application Load Balancer (ALB) and NAT Gateway.
* **Private subnets** contain sensitive resources such as the RDS database and EKS worker nodes.
* **Security groups** enforce least-privilege access, ensuring services only communicate where explicitly required.

This separation of concerns creates a secure perimeter, protecting the database and backend from direct internet exposure.

---

## 2. Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

EKS is the compute backbone for NewsPulse. It allows containerized services ‚Äî such as the API, processor, and frontend ‚Äî to run with resilience and scalability.

* **Node groups** are divided between **system workloads** (monitoring, ingress controllers) and **application workloads** (API, processors).
* **IAM OIDC provider** is enabled to support IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts), ensuring fine-grained, pod-level access to AWS services.

This approach future-proofs the system, enabling GitOps, automated scaling, and canary deployments.

---

## 3. Amazon RDS (Postgres)

News metadata, user profiles, and recommendation data are stored in **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)**.

* Fully managed service ensures **automated backups, patching, and failover**.
* Hosted in **private subnets** for security.
* Credentials are stored in **AWS Secrets Manager**, preventing hardcoding in code or configs.

The relational structure allows complex queries (e.g., ‚Äútop articles in the last 24 hours per region‚Äù) with high efficiency.

---

## 4. Amazon S3 Buckets

Unstructured and analytical data flows into Amazon S3.

* **`news-raw` bucket**: Stores full articles and original content for archival and potential reprocessing.
* **`news-analytics` bucket**: Holds processed results, query logs, and Athena-compatible datasets.
* **Lifecycle policies** move older data to **Glacier**, minimizing cost while retaining history.

This provides a highly durable, cost-optimized storage layer.

---

## 5. Amazon Kinesis Data Stream

Real-time ingestion is powered by **Kinesis Data Streams**.

* Articles fetched by Lambda (ingestor) are published to the stream.
* A **processor service** consumes from the stream, calling **AWS Comprehend** for sentiment and entity tagging.
* The stream provides **buffering and decoupling**, ensuring no data loss during traffic spikes (e.g., breaking news events).

This ensures resilience and smooth handling of high-volume data pipelines.

---

## 6. Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)

ECR serves as the **container image repository** for the project.

* Holds Docker images for the **API**, **processor**, and **frontend**.
* Integrated with **Jenkins CI/CD**, enabling build, scan, and push workflows.
* Secure IAM policies ensure only authorized pipelines and EKS nodes can pull images.

This guarantees a clean, auditable supply chain for application deployment.

---

## 7. Route53 & ACM (Domain & Security)

To provide a professional, secure experience, Route53 and ACM are configured:

* **Route53** manages DNS for `newspulse.dev` and subdomains (`api.newspulse.dev`, `app.newspulse.dev`).
* **ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)** issues TLS certificates for end-to-end HTTPS encryption.

This combination ensures the platform is both accessible and trustworthy to users.

---

## Conclusion

Step 1 lays down the **infrastructure backbone** of NewsPulse. With networking, compute, storage, and streaming in place, the system has the essential building blocks for scalability, reliability, and security. Subsequent steps will build on this foundation ‚Äî deploying ingestion pipelines, processors, APIs, and frontend applications with confidence.
